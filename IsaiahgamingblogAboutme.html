	<td class="Row-style">Hello there and thank you for visiting my little website! A little about me is that I have been video games since I was little. I enjoy all types of games but my favorite is first person shooters. I have almost every platform except a PC which is why I only included consoles. That's pretty much it and thank you once again! </td></tr>
